        <h5>Dark Cacao Cookie is the strict and protective monarch of the Dark Cacao Kingdom. While an Ancient Hero who earns the respect of his subjects, his voice lines hint that he has grown weary of such duty. Despite this, his resolve to protect his kingdom and Earthbread allows him to continue bearing the responsibilities he swore to uphold.Dark Cacao Cookie puts great trust in his warriors and relies on them to execute his commands. However, his belief in his kingdom has made him vulnerable to Cookies like Affogato Cookie who feigned loyalty with his ulterior motives.

          The reasons why one of my favorite characters is Dark Cacao, is because of how he was introduced in the story as more of possessed leader and his right hand Affogato Cookie. However, his character is so much deeper than the exterior of his introduction and the story. He has a son Dark Choco Cookie that have almost killed him, as well much more sadder events of the story that have caused him to be on the outside a possessive leader for power.
