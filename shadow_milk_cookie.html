        <h5>Shadow Milk Cookie. Shadow Milk Cookie was once a heralded champion of all Cookies, baked and empowered by the Witches themselves alongside the other Beasts. He was granted the divine Virtue of Knowledge, becoming known as the Fount of Knowledge. However, despite his nigh-omniscient perception of the world, he saw how Cookies often shied away from bitter Truths and chose to believe in sweet Deceits instead. Now he is a cruel and manipulative soul, casting himself as a mere entertainer to purposely contrast the destructive consequences of the chaos he sows, to bring about "a world where lies and truths can't be told apart."

          Shadow milk is one of the complex characters that I have seen in media. As Dark Cacao Cookie he is complex, however, Shadow Milk Cookie is an evidence of how much a complex character can be mischaracterize into a blue silly jester. He cannot show his proper emotion of vurnebility and true emotion without lashing out on someone. He shows clear abondament and betrayal issues, because of how he reacted to someone who offered to be his friend. He cannot trust someone who is kind because of how much fear he shows that he lashes out on a character, and backs off as he prefers to be lonely and not betrayed once again.
