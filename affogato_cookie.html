        <h5>Affogato Cookie is a cunning and manipulative schemer, driven by an insatiable desire for power and control. With a silver tongue he weaves deception effortlessly, persuading those around him to act in his favor while keeping his own hands clean. He thrives in the shadows, orchestrating downfall through whispered rumors, backhanded compliments, and veiled threats, all while maintaining an outward persona of loyalty and devotion. In the story he tries to take the throne, and take over the Dark Cacao Kingdom

          He's my favorite character because of how his very evil personality is shown in the story very well. I really like how he is presented and introduced in the story because the story makes you hate him, his personality is very slimy, dishonest, and very power hungry. However, I don't hate him as I am enjoyer of villain characters without redemption. In the story he didn't get any redemption, and that was the best part of it. As villains that have such slimy personality and he have done awful things as banishing a loyal soldier of the Dark Cacao Kingdom, as that was his plan to take over the throne.
